Oh, I thought, I thought
You did forget to lock the door
(It's locked)
But you didn't, you remembered
It was the key
(Yeah)

Oh, I thought, I really thought
You were an idiot
But it turns out, that I was the one
Who's an idiot

It was just them
It was not you who was the problem
Oh-oh, I judged you too soon
And left the truth
I didn't know they used the key

I didn't know they used the key
Oh yeah
I know I'm wrong
I swear I didn't know
That's why, I'm sorry my bro
