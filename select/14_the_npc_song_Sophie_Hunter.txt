E-boy wanna email IR, IRL
But IDK, DK
The HTML
F-U-C-K, C-K
Also LOL
Stuck in screen saves
Freeze frame
In digital hell, hell, hell, hell
Hello baby how can I help you?
Who do you want to project today?
Say the name I'll be her and
Your ex and mama too
Hit the video, I lock eyes with
Your libido and pump it
Pump up his heart like it's cardio
Gave him a peak now he'll die for
This peach like he's Mario, ah
Cartoon heart eyes, Casio smile
Casing the joint, keeping his clicks
In case I need to point him
Around and then back to me
Penny for his thoughts
When I tell them to the factory
And I tell the factory
Best believe that I'd do better
If I could but I do one thing well
It's being no damn good
He's making no type sense
But I know damn good and well
He's thinking, how to type
You wanna URL?

Hello baby how can I help you?

Say the name I'll be her and
Your ex and mama too
Hit the video, I lock eyes with
Your libido and pump it
Pull up baby
I know you wish you could pull up
Feel like Reiki
How I love from far away
He's full of it
Loves me cause I'm full of him
Anyone and everyone
Behind a screen
He loves it cause
He can't touch me
Tap me like a Visa
Fly me baby out to Ibiza
Turn the brightness low
Get sand up in my crack
On the beach, ah
Do me better than I ever
Baby, update my features
Get me wetter than the ocean
Now I'm dead
Nice to meet ya!
