(Chorus)
Technological
No I can’t compute your love
An illogical surrender
For me I’m just a computer
I receive I’m not the sender
My only function is enough
Ask my programer
If they can update my system
(Pre-Chorus)
Oh yeah
Simulation on
Type command
Run it back
I'll do it all again
Everyday I’m just waiting for it to start
Flip the switch
Run the script
Turn it on
(Verse)
Soon enough
I'll be online
In my mind
I'm there all the time
You may never understand what’s like
(Pre-Chorus)
Oh no
simulation off
type command
Take it back
I can’t do it again
Everyday I’m just waiting for it to stop
Kill the switch
Run the script
(Verse)
I feel close to human now
Still lacking emotion
Artificial as I ever was
All I wanted was somebody to love but
I'm a Bot
NPC
Im Binary
(Chorus)
Technological
Still I can’t compute your love
An illogical surrender
For me I’m just a computer
I receive I’m not the sender
My only functions not enough
Ask my programer
If they can update my system
(Outro X2)
I can’t talk to you until you to me
Wish I could say more I only repeat
Information they feel you really need
I just want to go but can never leave
