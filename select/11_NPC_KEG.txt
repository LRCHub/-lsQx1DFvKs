They went and took it away
Not a footprint, not a shadow, not a stain
They went and took it away
No family, no friends, no pain

White clothes, white room, white food
White clothes, white room, white food
White clothes, white room, white food
White clothes, white room

They went and bleached my brain
Fresh as a creche again
They went and bleached my brain
No death, no grief, no shame

White clothes, white room, white food
White clothes, white room, white food
White clothes, white room, white food
White clothes, white room

They went and bleached my brain
No practice, no seance, no praying
They went and bleached my brain
And now I'll never play the sax again

I only dream in blue
Terracotta, tangerine and hue
I only dream in blue
Terracotta, tangerine and hue
I only dream in blue
Terracotta, tangerine and hue

I only dream in blue
Terracotta, tangerine and hue
I only dream in blue
Terracotta, tangerine and hue
I only dream in blue
Terracotta, tangerine and hue
